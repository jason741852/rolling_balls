This project is built on Unity 5.3.5

This is a simple rolling balls game I expanded based on "Roll-a-ball" tutorial in Unity.

A second player ("player2") is added, which is control by WASD buttons, while player1 is controlled by arrow keys.

The goal of the game is to compete each other and collect the most objects.


The C# scripts are written the way that more players can easily be added by duplicating the player object.
