# Roll-a-ball Game 
This is a simple rolling balls game I expanded based on "Roll-a-ball" tutorial in Unity, written in C#. 

## Deployment 

This project is built on Unity 5.3.5 and can be compiled and run in Unity. 

## Expansions 
Player one is controlled by arrow keys. 
I added a second player ("player2"), which is control by WASD buttons. 
The C# scripts are written to allow the duplication of the player object to allow more players. 

## Playing Instructions 
The goal of the game is to compete each other and collect the most objects.
Move the ball using the correct keys to collect the most objects to win. Player one uses the arrow keys, and player two uses the WASD buttons.
